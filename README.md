- Hi, I’m @fukkaer
- I program in my free time.
- I'm Unemployed. Need job as junior programmer.
- I’m interested in Programming, that's why I'm on GitHub.
- Did courses in Python since the start of 2021, currently doing self study, and pet projects until i get hired.
- I’m currently learning:
-  SQL, because it never hurts to know how to interact with servers. 
-  Soon C++, because game development may be interesting at some point.
- I might look to collaborate

- Future Projects: create Machine learning algorithm at some point. Maybe create O.S that runs over windows, just because the idea is intriguing.
- Pro tip: Remember to create the necessary txt files, needed by your compiled exe's, so you don't spend 10 minutes figuring out what caused a crash on startup.

- Taking a break for a few days
