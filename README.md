- Hi, I’m @fukkaer
- I program in my free time.
- I'm Part time in library.
- I’m kind of interested in Programming, that's why I'm on GitHub.
- Did courses in Python since the start of 2021, currently doing self study, and pet projects.
- I’m currently learning:
-  SQL, because it never hurts to know how to interact with servers. 
-  Soon C++, because game development may be interesting at some point.
- How to reach me:
- Email: fukno6787@gmail.com
- Twitter: [@fukkaer](https://www.twitter.com/fukkaer) Send me a DM otherwise I won't notice, they get forwarded to my email.
- Linkedin: No Linkedin, there's too much spam.
- .
- .
- Future Projects: create Machine learning algorithm at some point. Maybe create O.S that runs on windows as an exe, just because the idea is stupid.
- Pro tip: Give up and become an engineer instead, it's far easier to get a job.
- .
- Taking a break for a few days
- .
- Update, more like a few years, lol
